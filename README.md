The legs parts should be connected by 22mm tubes (carbon, aluminium or whatever you want).
The legs should be connectet to the body with a 8mm rod 

The body is incomplete. you need to carve it and designe the differential bar

Is a very simple part, have a look here to have an idea of what you need to design:

In the part file there is a bar
